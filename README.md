# LedgerForge: Streamlined Financial Data Aggregation and Analysis

LedgerForge is a Python-based framework designed to simplify the process of collecting, transforming, and analyzing financial data from various sources. In today's complex financial landscape, accessing and consolidating data from disparate platforms is a significant challenge. LedgerForge addresses this by providing a modular and extensible system for connecting to different financial APIs, databases, and file formats. It empowers developers and analysts to quickly build robust data pipelines for a wide range of applications, including portfolio tracking, algorithmic trading, risk management, and financial reporting.

The core purpose of LedgerForge is to abstract away the complexities of data acquisition and normalization, allowing users to focus on the actual analysis and decision-making process. It achieves this through a layered architecture, where data connectors handle the specifics of interacting with external sources, data transformers cleanse and standardize the data, and data storage modules persist the processed information. This separation of concerns ensures that the system remains adaptable to evolving data sources and analytical requirements. Furthermore, LedgerForge emphasizes data integrity and reliability by incorporating comprehensive error handling and data validation mechanisms throughout the pipeline.

LedgerForge is not just a data aggregation tool; it's a development platform for building sophisticated financial applications. It provides a flexible framework for defining custom data transformations, implementing complex trading strategies, and generating insightful visualizations. By leveraging the power of Python and its rich ecosystem of libraries, LedgerForge allows users to rapidly prototype and deploy solutions that meet their specific needs. Whether you're a seasoned financial professional or a budding data scientist, LedgerForge provides the tools and resources you need to unlock the full potential of your financial data. It promotes efficiency, accuracy, and innovation in financial analysis.

### Key Features

*   **Modular Data Connectors:** Supports pluggable data connectors for various financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) and data sources (e.g., CSV, Excel, SQL databases). Each connector is responsible for retrieving data from its respective source and converting it into a standardized format. To implement a new connector, you need to create a class that inherits from the `BaseConnector` class and implement the `fetch_data()` method. The `fetch_data()` method must return a pandas DataFrame containing the requested data. Example:



*   **Flexible Data Transformation Pipeline:** Offers a configurable data transformation pipeline to clean, normalize, and enrich financial data. The pipeline supports various transformations, including data type conversion, missing value imputation, outlier detection, and feature engineering. Transformations are defined as functions that accept a pandas DataFrame as input and return a transformed DataFrame. These functions can be chained together to create a complex transformation pipeline.

*   **Extensible Data Storage:** Provides options for storing processed data in various formats, including CSV, Parquet, SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), and cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage). Storage adapters encapsulate the logic for writing data to different storage systems. To add support for a new storage system, you need to create a class that inherits from the `BaseStorageAdapter` class and implement the `write_data()` method.

*   **Data Validation and Error Handling:** Incorporates robust data validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and reliability. The system validates data against predefined schemas and raises exceptions for invalid data. Error handling is implemented using try-except blocks and logging to capture and report errors.

*   **API Abstraction:** Provides a high-level API for accessing and manipulating financial data, abstracting away the underlying complexities of data sources and transformation pipelines. This API allows users to easily query data, apply transformations, and store results without having to write complex code.

*   **Concurrency and Scalability:** Designed for handling large datasets and high data volumes. Leverages multiprocessing and asynchronous programming techniques to improve performance and scalability. The system can be deployed on multiple machines to handle even larger datasets.

### Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing LedgerForge.
*   **Pandas:** A powerful data analysis and manipulation library used for working with tabular data.
*   **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for numerical operations.
*   **SQLAlchemy:** A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with SQL databases.
*   **requests:** A Python library for making HTTP requests to interact with financial APIs.
*   **Logging:** Python's built-in logging module for tracking events and debugging.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/LedgerForge.git
    cd LedgerForge

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Configuration

LedgerForge requires certain environment variables to be configured properly. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

FINANCIAL_API_KEY=your_api_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

*   `FINANCIAL_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing the financial API. Replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for connecting to the database. Replace `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `database` with your actual database credentials.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level for the application. Valid values are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`.

### Usage

The core component is the `LedgerForgePipeline` which needs to be initialized with a connector, transformer, and storage adapter.



Detailed API documentation including specific classes and methods can be found in the `docs` directory.
